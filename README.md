Image Processor Activity
========================
An Open Source platform application hosted at sugarlabs. Its an open source organization with the motive of free laptop per child.

Activity gives an environment for learning and thereby helping gain knowledge for children in rural areas and underdeveloped areas who are given free laptops for learning. 


The Activity is developed in python language and runs as an executable over XO laptops. Activity starts with taking input a user
input that could be through camera or from local hard disk of the computer. The image processor activity is a simple tool, 
an activity to play and learn with images.Gives a user an ability to take a real time photo through webcam and start processing 
on it. 

It covers most of the filtering options one can apply to an image like making an image black and white , making a mirror 
image of the original , invert , solarize and many more options. This activity also provides a user to watermark an image over 
another using different styles like "tile", etc. And one can also write and watermark a text over the image in some places and 
can make it bold by reclicking the same text at same position. This activity provides a user to save an intermediate image that 
can be reused,if latter image finds an error. The Image processor activity also has features one would expect of a standard 
image viewer, like zoom, rotate etc.
